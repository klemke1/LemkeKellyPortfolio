# Graphic Redesign
This visualization contains great information but it is not presented in a very consumer friendly way. For one, the graph contains many numbers, especially to depict the month and year. Having the year there is redundant and not necessary to the graph because the title already states that it is in 2021 so we can assume it is the 12 months from that year. Instead they should have used the name of the month- maybe even an abbreviation depending on how wide the graph ends up being so that it is not cluttered. I also think the medium gray background is unnecessary, the gray lines coordinating with the y axis get a little lost so the background should be white. They could have done this especially since they have black border lines to show where the graph starts and stops. I also think the font colors are a bit in your face and there is not a reason to use a hard to see/read color here. Instead, it should be black and enlarged in size to make it more visible. Same applies to the title, it should be bigger and not in blue.
When redone, I think it's also important to determine why we are trying to show people this data? It seems like it is important to inform people of the most dangerous months where these fatalities may happen so that they can be more prepared and educated when these accidents may happen. If there was data on what type of accidents occurred in each month, that would be super helpful as a second graphic to include in the same format.
