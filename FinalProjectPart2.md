## User Research
# The target audience you hope to reach with your story
The target audience I hope to reach with this story is people who have some sort of stake in football and athletics at large. The biggest buy in I need is from coaches, athletic trainers, the players and those closely involved with the safety of the players in the NFL. For my user research though, I need to understand what kind of support these policies would need and who better than to reach out to fans directly who consume the media surrounding the sport. If fans are satisfied or unsatisfied with the league, their business improves or suffers. Doing research within the fan bases is important because fans keep up with their teams and many other players on opposing teams to track their chances of success in fantasy football. If fans care about the safety of the players, they will get to see their team avoid injuries which can be detrimental to a team’s season.
# Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Fortunately, I have several people in my life who follow the NFL very closely whether they care more about fantasy, in season or just the Super Bowl. All those perspectives are valuable in talking about injuries because all of them have differing perspectives on how injuries like concussions affect their view of the league. I identified three people to interview, one is my dad who I learned everything about football from. He knows a lot and follows a ton of sports related content with the NFL being his favorite and most closely watched. Additionally, I selected two other people who are more fringe fans who have also played competitive sports themselves. Having an athlete’s experience is very important because they have lived experiences with injuries and how that affects players long term. Many athletes will quit their sport due to a persistent injury and fear that it will happen again which is very prevalent in concussion injuries. Especially given that many concussions are not properly diagnosed or treated. 
# Interview script
  - Have you ever had a concussion from a contact sport? 
  - In the NFL, concussions are a serious problem and injury, what has been your opinion about steps the league is taking to decrease concussion rates?
      Are they doing enough or not enough?
  - What rule changes do you believe should be put in place to prevent concussions in the NFL? ie) get rid of kicking or enforce larger penalties
  - Are there ways the game should be changed overall to prevent concussions?
  - Are the current protective equipment standards enough for protecting players- why or why not?
  - What aspects of concussions do you think are most important to document? ie) severity, when they occur etc.
  - What do you think could convince coaches and owners to take concussions more seriously? ie) public pressure, advocacy, or stronger protocols etc?
  - Looking at the sketches of graphs, do you have any input that would make this more convincing to someone to make changes to reduce NFL concussion injury rates?
# The findings from your interviews and changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
	After doing user research, I discovered a different lens that would be helpful to examine with this project. I interviewed three people, two of which were students in their 20s and one other person who has been a life long fan of the league in his 50s. Initially I planned on looking at helmet standards, preseason vs regular season concussions, and rule changes. After speaking to several individuals, it was obvious I needed to focus more on positions on the field because often rule changes are implemented with the intent of protecting certain players in a situation. In football, there is a concept of a ‘defenseless player’ in which the quarterback is the first position that comes to mind. Other players other than the quarterback can be in a defenseless position- such as a player who is attempting to catch a ball and has not become a runner yet or a player already on the ground. In one of my interviews, they mentioned that “in my opinion, if kicking was eliminated from the game, a lot less injuries would occur”. When kicking occurs in the game, the player receiving the kick is not running, but is still and is facing the whole other team who is running toward him as he is trying to return the ball. The other team is building up speed to tackle the kick returner and they are starting from 0 mph with little momentum which makes them more susceptible to the oncoming player's impact. 
	
	Additionally, another problem that was brought up was the aspect of coaches who make their players come back too fast without proper recovery and rest. A prime example of this was brought up by another interviewee about Tua Tagovailoa’s injury this past 2022 season. He is the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins and he suffered a rough tackle that hit his head. He tried to stand up afterward and instead crumpled back down to the ground. While seemingly obvious that he was not okay and suffered a head injury, the Dolphins coach determined it was a back issue and he was allowed to return to play. [Tua Tagovailoa injury Story](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoa-concussion-nflpa-initiating-new-investigation-nfl-says-qb-didnt-show-or-report-symptoms/)
	
	The coach insisted in this case that he had suffered from back injury earlier in practice and this was a persisting problem, instead of a head injury. So, this brought about the conversation about how we incentivize coaches against putting their players back in action before they are medically cleared. The coaches' jobs depend on their ability to win and the NFL is a business, if the star QB is not playing, it might hurt the result of the game and also the business because fans don’t want to watch the backup on Sunday Night Football. Another interviewee commented on this idea “The coaches are not medical professionals so they should not be making any decisions regarding a player’s status on return to play.” I think this is definitely valid and in the Miami Dolphins case, the coach should not have been making any excuses for him to return to play as he clearly hit his head hard after a tackle. A tackle, that occurred after he had thrown the ball- illegal in the sport. 
	
	As for how this will affect my visualizations, I am adding position data on positions that are most likely to experience concussions, which as shown on my Shorthand, there are clearly positions that have higher rates of concussions than others. Because of this, I will also look into how rule changes can affect this. I also am going to focus more on the coaches for the call to action (on my Shorthand draft) because they can terminate any player at any time so the players may feel pressure to comply with what their coach wants. Coaches can also lose their jobs if they lose enough, sometimes in the middle of the season. It is important to protect both the players and the coaches. I added a visualization that was pulled from the [NFL weekly injury report](https://www.nfl.com/injuries/) from the 2022 season and how concussions magically disappeared once teams hit the post season playing (the red numbers). The league is competitive and knowing about your opponent's strongest players condition can be an advantage and affect how you play your game. For example, Patrick Mahomes had a high ankle sprain heading into the last two post season games and the opposing teams played in such a way that they tried to make him run more with their defensive setup. Although not a concussion injury, it still applies the same if one had a concussion or was thought to not be at their best. 
	
	My call to action was influenced by my user research. I heavily relied on them to scope my project and found it helpful to narrow it down. I talked about the business aspect of the NFL by including coach salaries and comparing that to the teams who have the highest rates of concussions in the league. I did find overlap there which is very important to note.

		I used both Flourish and Tableau for creating my visualizations. I also utilized Canva for sizing purposes to make it fit into my Shorthand presentation. I used a timeline Shorthand template that allowed me to tell my story more effectively and leave the reader with an engaging yet readable presentation. All my sources are included as links by their respective graphs or information.
