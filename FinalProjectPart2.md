## User Research
# The target audience you hope to reach with your story
The target audience I hope to reach with this story is people who have some sort of stake in football and athletics at large. The biggest buy in I need is from coaches, athletic trainers, the players and those closely involved with the safety of the players in the NFL. For my user research though, I need to understand what kind of support these policies would need and who better than to reach out to fans directly who consume the media surrounding the sport. If fans are satisfied or unsatisfied with the league, their business improves or suffers. Doing research within the fan bases is important because fans keep up with their teams and many other players on opposing teams to track their chances of success in fantasy football. If fans care about the safety of the players, they will get to see their team avoid injuries which can be detrimental to a team’s season.
# Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Fortunately, I have several people in my life who follow the NFL very closely whether they care more about fantasy, in season or just the Super Bowl. All those perspectives are valuable in talking about injuries because all of them have differing perspectives on how injuries like concussions affect their view of the league. I identified three people to interview, one is my dad who I learned everything about football from. He knows a lot and follows a ton of sports related content with the NFL being his favorite and most closely watched. Additionally, I selected two other people who are more fringe fans who have also played competitive sports themselves. Having an athlete’s experience is very important because they have lived experiences with injuries and how that affects players long term. Many athletes will quit their sport due to a persistent injury and fear that it will happen again which is very prevalent in concussion injuries. Especially given that many concussions are not properly diagnosed or treated.
