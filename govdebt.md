# Flourish Gov Debt Visualization Personalized
This graph includes all of Australia's data from 1996 to 2020 which I changed from what was initially displayed. I hollowed the plotted dots so that they stood out easier against the color of the lines. I kept the color a dark blue so that it contrasted enough against the white background and light grey lines. I kept the light grey grid lines which makes it easier to see what percent it is according to the Y axis. Additionally, I added labels to both axes to show what they are representing, including making them large and darker so they stand out. The Y Axis also was written specifically with as little words possible to get the point across as simply as possible. The title was also added so the reader knew what they were looking at right away. When choosing the line curve, I chose a natural curve because debt is fluid and does not start over year to year so I did not use a step curve wihch seems more rigid.
