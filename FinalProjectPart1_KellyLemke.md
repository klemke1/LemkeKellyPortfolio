# Final Project: 
This is my final project for Carnegie Mellon's Telling Stories with Data.
# Outline
  Analyzing concussions in the NFL is something that has gathered a lot of attention, even from outside the football community. Football as a sport has been deemed one of the most dangerous sports with high rates of injuries plaguing the sports for years. Especially as the game advances and players get better, rules in the game have been adjusted to keep players safer and the game competitive. In this project, I am analyzing the rate of concussions in the NFL and how the safety plans of the league are supporting the mission of safety and fairness. I hope to draw parallels between helmet standards, preseason practices, and rule changes and how that affects concussion rates in the league. There is a lot of research being done to improve the helmet standards such as the NFL Helmet Challenge which allotted over 2 million to several teams which supoorted the development of new prototype helmets. Helmets undergo biomedical laboratory testing every year to determine the best performance possible for player's equipment. Preseason practices are tracked as well to determine when and how concussions may happepen and reduce the likelihood of player injuries. Rule changes also can have a huge impact on the playerâ€™s safety by incentivizing players to make cleaner tackles and blocks by implementing more penalties. Penalties can make or break a result in a game so playing by the rules is important in order to give your team the best chance at winning.  
# Initial Sketches
  This initial sketch is to show the number of concussions in the regular season. The top group is the totals for each year, followed by concussions in practice, and regular season concussions occuring in games. This shows the trend over the years of concussions in the regular season and this is a rough sketch of how the concussion rate has changed over the years. While the league had made progress, it shows that in the last two years, concussions rates have risen which is why additional data should be shown to display helmet standard changes, preseason practice data, and rule changes. If there are trends that would lead to an increase in concussions, it will be shown as a relationship and therefore lead to a call to change for the league.

# The Data
  My data sources are mainly from the NFL directly. They cannot release all data on players due to the medical nature of it, but injury reports are publicly available for the season. Link[https://www.nfl.com/playerhealthandsafety/health-and-wellness/injury-data/injury-data]
  It is also important to utilize funding as a data point (also from the NFL) because it shows which teams are investing most heavily in safety strategies. I hope to uncover some trends among teams and what teams have the lowest injury rates- specifically concusssions. The NFL does release an injury report each year since 2012 so you can go back and see what trends are looking like year to year in each of the three areas I am going to examine.

  There are some years where they focus more on concussions than others. The 2016 report is one of the most robust with concussion specific information. Link[https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/v1597323229/league/odido2a0jik6eu9kgzyu.pdf]
  But with the recent rise of concussion rates, it has entered the news cycle once again. There are plenty of outside data sources that examine professional football athletes. I want to include an interactive visualization that shows what part of the brain is affected by concussions because rule changes such as field goal range, return range, and certain blocking techniques are less safe depending on where the player initiates contact with their opponent. Link[https://www.center4research.org/football-brain-injuries-need-know/] Devling deeper into the rules to try and prevent dangerous contact is essential to understanding the concussion rate and how effective the rules are to preventing serious and repeated injuries. 
  
# Method and Medium
  I plan on utilizing Shorthand to tell my story of the history of football concussion rates, and what is being done today to reduce the number of injuries. I want to give the reader the ability to understand what happens to a brain when it experiences a concussion which is essential to get buy in from the audience so that they care. I also want to include sections that dive into each area- helmet standards, preseason practices, and rule changes and how these affect the rate of concussions which leads to the call to action. While the league has acknowledged the dangers of concussions, there is definitely more to be done to prevent injuries to their players.
