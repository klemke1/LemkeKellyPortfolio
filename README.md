Kelly Lemke's Portfolio
# Portfolio
This is my first Github portfolio.
# About Me
I am a second year MSPPM student at Heinz. I have worked in academic research the past two years and did my summer internship at an environmental consulting firm. I really enjoy building client relationships and managing people and helping them be successful! In 5 years, I hope to have my own team working for me at a firm. Beyond my professional and academic life, I love spending time outdoors, including playing tennis, pickleball, working out, yoga, volleyball and many other things. I played soccer as a student athlete in both undergrad and graduate school which is why I still love being active and playing other sports for fun with my friends. 
# What I Hope to Learn
I am hoping to build upon skills built in design classes and put the technical know how behind that. I hope to be working as a Project Manager or Consultant upon graduation. I also want to learn how to best present information so that it serves me in my professional life when I work with clients and need to distribute information to stakeholders on projects.
