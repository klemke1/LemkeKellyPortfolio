# NFL Concussion Rates
# The final data story

This is my completed Shorthand website with my final project for CMU Heinz's Telling Stories with Data.

# Changes made since Part II
> Since Part 2, I made significant changes to my Shorthand. I changed the colors to be more cohesive within the story and theme of football. This change was initiated by peer feedback and also the pictures that were added afterward. I was struggling with where to add color since initially I was not sure if it was necessary or not. I think it looks much more engaging with color. It also helps with interpretation too, the offensive and defensive bubble chart was much easier to understand once the colors were different because it was a scrollmation. It made them both more distinct when they transition from defense to offense. I also made the biggest change to the last two visualizations. I joined the data together so that the visualization was easier to understand. I was trying to make the relationship more clear between coach pay and higher rates of concussions. I wanted to incorporate a visual that was more graphic in nature rather than another table or graph. I liked the addition of helmets and the dollars which made it easy to understand what I was getting at. I really enjoyed using the helmets too since its a call out of the specific teams in a creative way. I also made the fonts and sizes of data markers to be more pronounced so that when I was presenting it would be easier to see as I was quickly scrolling through.

## The audience
> When identifyng the audience, user research was really helpful because I was able to talk to all people who both understood football completely, or had varying understanding of the game and injuries that occur. The people who knew football less were actually more helpful because we only had 60 seconds to present so keeping it simpler was very important to me. I think it was also safer to assume people did not know as much about football as others. For example, when I put together the coaches pay and concussion rate together, I kept the helmets as the team's respective helmet and kept the names so people could see both. I really appreciated their insight because it made me step outside my own knowledge. The feedback on the colors was also helpful because I initially just used bland colors like rescale and for the presentation, it made more sense to use engaging and distinctive colors.


## Final design decisions
> My final design choices outside of the audience, were to make the presentation as consumable for a 60 second presentation. I  utilized the scrollmation templates and made changes to it as I saw fit as I went. One thing I found frustrating was getting the right display, I was very specific in how I wanted each graphic to show up, so none of it was cut off or close to the edges. It did not go unnoticed as a classmate made a comment after my presentation that it was really easy to follow and everything made sense. I felt like the presentation really came together in Part 3, the design, color choices, the layout, and I got really familiar with it before the presentation. The story I think did a good job of giving some background on the topic, but not too much so that it was boring. The story I thought flowed really well and the data was there to support. 

## References
> All of my sources are cited on my Shorthand Website under or is clearly marked by the piece of media. Using the steps on Canvas, the turnitin option does not show up for me although I tried submitting several times (should be viewable on Canvas). I ran my Shorthand through TurnItIn through my own account and other than the direct quotes that are properly cited and quoted, no plagarism was found and I got a green checkmark.

# Final thoughts
>  Overall, the hardest thing about this project was getting enough data and scraping it manually. As I did not have a complete data set, I had to pull from several sources over the course and some hard numbers had to be scraped manually which was taxing. It was worth it though and I got really great information especially given that medical information is kind of hard to find. One thing that came out just after my presentation was given (that afternoon) was a survey put out by the NFL Player's Association. They released scores on a letter grading scale on how each team's players felt about a broad array of topics like staff, facility quality, and travel plans. This would have been cool to have before I did my presentation but would have required more manual data scraping.

>  I really enjoyed this project and class because it trained me more on how I should stay narrow in a topic so that I can really 'teach' someone about a certain topic. I learned that I can fit a lot more into a minute that I thought I could. I used the rule that each section got a single sentence and that was a perfect way to stay at just under a minute and finish before the timer went off. I am really proud of what I was able to create and think that it tells a story about something that is very important to football and extends into other sports both professional and amateur.
