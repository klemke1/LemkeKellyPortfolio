This is my completed Shorthand website with my final project for CMU Heinz's Telling Stories with Data.

# Changes made since Part II
> Since Part 2, I made significant changes to my Shorthand. I changed the colors to be more cohesive within the story and theme of football. This change was initiated by peer feedback and also the pictures that were added afterward. I was struggling with where to add color since initially I was not sure if it was necessary or not. I think it looks much more engaging with color. It also helps with interpretation too, the offensive and defensive bubble chart was much easier to understand once the colors were different because it was a scrollmation. It made them both more distinct when they transition from defense to offense. I also made the biggest change to the last two visualizations. I joined the data together so that the visualization was easier to understand. I was trying to make the relationship more clear between coach pay and higher rates of concussions. I wanted to incorporate a visual that was more graphic in nature rather than another table or graph. I liked the addition of helmets and the dollars which made it easy to understand what I was getting at. I really enjoyed using the helmets too since its a call out of the specific teams in a creative way. I also made the fonts and sizes of data markers to be more pronounced so that when I was presenting it would be easier to see as I was quickly scrolling through.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

When identifyng the audience, user research was really helpful because I was able to talk to all people who both understood football completely, or had varying understanding of the game and injuries that occur. The people who knew football less were actually more helpful because we only had 60 seconds to present so keeping it simpler was very important to me. I think it was also safer to assume people did not know as much about football as others. For example, when I put together the coaches pay and concussion rate together, I kept the helmets as the team's respective helmet and kept the names so people could see both. I really appreciated their insight because it made me step outside my own knowledge. The feedback on the colors was also helpful because I initially just used bland colors like rescale and for the presentation, it made more sense to use engaging and distinctive colors.


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
