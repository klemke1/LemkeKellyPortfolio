# Graphic Redesign
This visualization contains great information but it is not presented in a very consumer friendly way. For one, the graph contains many numbers, especially to depict the month and year. Having the year there is redundant and not necessary to the graph because the title already states that it is in 2021 so we can assume it is the 12 months from that year. Instead they should have used the name of the month- maybe even an abbreviation depending on how wide the graph ends up being so that it is not cluttered. I also think the medium gray background is unnecessary, the gray lines coordinating with the y axis get a little lost so the background should be white. They could have done this especially since they have black border lines to show where the graph starts and stops. I also think the font colors are a bit in your face and there is not a reason to use a hard to see/read color here. Instead, it should be black and enlarged in size to make it more visible. Same applies to the title, it should be bigger and not in blue.

When redesigning, I think it's also important to determine why we are trying to show people this data? It seems like it is important to inform people of the most dangerous months where these fatalities may happen so that they can be more prepared and educated when these accidents may happen. If there was data on what type of accidents occurred in each month, that would be super helpful as a second graphic to include in the same format. 
When I sketched this out initially, I wanted to include the fatalities in numbers in an easily presentable way with a dark red since we are talking about deathes. The lines were quickly able to be identified and the months were easier to read as opposed to the original.

I also tried a different approach where I decided to only label the top 5 most fatal months with the intention of highlighting these months for the consumer so they could remember just a few months. These months tend to be more dangerous and they can read the rest of the article for context as to why they should pay extra attention to these month's weather events to avoid any damage.

Once I had my ideas gathered onto sketches, I put the data into Tableau and found some other displays of the data that I liked even better that worked to show the most dangerous months very clearly. I was able to include the fatalities values on the treemap, named each month and utilized a dark red again to signify the deaths. It is very clear to see which months are the most fatal as they are physically taking up more space on the screen and are the darkest months. I also liked this redesign because we read left to right which means that we can easily get the most important information first as soon as we read the graph.

I initially showed the above visualization to my two non classmate critiquers after we did the in class excercise and I was feeling very confident that they would not have any feedback to improve it. However, they did have some suggestions that I added in my final redesign. One mentioned that in the five second intial viewing, she was a little confused by the numbers thinking maybe they were years or something, but quickly realized they were the number of fatalities. Due to this, I did add a label to the values just to ensure no confusion about what the numbers were representing. Additionally, another mentioned the font size was kind of hard to read since it was so small at first glance. I bolded the values and increased the font size of the months to make sure it was easier to read. In this way, the title did not recevie any feedback, without the title, the only thing that you would not understand is the element of weather which the title provides including the year the set is referring to. 
Ultimately, after all the feedback I received, I think this is the best way to tell the story of dangerous weather months in a quick and easy to understand way. The color communicates the feelings you should experience while viewing, the year is clear, the data is organized in the way that we read, the values are labeled effectively and there is little way to misconstrue this data. If there was additional data as to what events occur in each months, it would be great to show that as a second graphic. But those events were only categorized by the year. Because my purpose was to show which months are the most dangerous, it would be additionally a benefit to let the consumer which events they should be aware of in each season. It would also be great to have information about which regions might be more affected. Although this data is not available in the set, those three graphics could tell almost all of the story with little need for text which is why I think my graphic redesign would be a great starting point in telling the whole story.
